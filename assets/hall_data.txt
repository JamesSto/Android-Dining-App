Risley
Risley
Cornell Dining's best-kept secret, Risley Dining is modeled after the Christchurch Refectory at Oxford University, maintaining the same gothic charm as when it first opened as the all-Ivy "Risley Great Hall" in 1913. While the dining room's atmosphere may be very "Harry Potter," our servery is completely up-to-date with a daily menu of pizza, pasta, hot traditional entrees, a stir fry station, grill and deli, salad bar, breakfast and fruit bar, and one of the best dessert stations around Chef Hans Butler works closely with residents to help plan annual unit specials, including the Day of Dead celebration each fall, and "A Night at Hogwarts" Harry Potter-themed dinner each spring.
